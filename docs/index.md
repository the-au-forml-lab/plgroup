Augusta University Programming Languages (PL) Reading Group is a regular
meeting to discuss exciting recent results in programming languages research.
The intent of the group is to learn about various ideas and generally broaden
perspectives on PL research topics. We randomly select papers from the major
PL conferences. At the end of the semester we gather for a lively discussion
to give prestigious awards to select papers.

**We meet weekly on Fridays at 3–4 pm in <mark>TBA</mark> (Summerville).**

We encourage everyone to join our reading group. Even if your primary focus
is not PL, this is a chance to learn about various new topics that may become
relevant to you later. It is also simply fun to hang out with us.

The PL Reading Group is a regular meeting of
[ΔΛΔ](https://augusta.presence.io/organization/delta-lambda-delta) student
organization.
