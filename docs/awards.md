## Fall 2025 Award Categories

#### Statue of Liberty

The Statue of Liberty is rich in symbolism.
The symbols collectively convey the message of freedom, democracy,
and hope for a better world.
This award goes to the paper that best represents the spirit of enlightenment
and the path to a brighter future.

#### The Key to My Soul

Some artpieces leave a lasting impression on the viewer.
They may leave you inspired to action, enchanted by their beauty,
humbled at the sheer skill that went into their creation,
or vexed with a message not yet fully clear to you.
Papers are much like art pieces in this regard, and this award
is for the paper that will stick with you for a very long time—the
one you will be telling your grandchildren about.

#### Everything Everywhere All At Once
Sign spinner. Hibachi chef. Chinese opera singer. Hotdog hands.
Infinite worlds, infinite possibilities. The beautiful chaos that
the winner of this award possesses has no bounds. What may seem like a 
whirlwind of information, too daunting to face, falls away to an 
exceptionally composed work that cuts through all that noise. That is, 
despite it's unforgiving nature at first glance, this paper opens up
to a profound and insightful work on closer inspection.

#### The Close Shave

This work nearly fell victim to complexity but instead found a 
brilliantly simple solution, being saved by the application of 
Occam's Razor. This is awarded to those that took complex problems 
and conquered them with surprisingly elegent or simple solutions.


#### Turning a New Leaf

Some arguments are so good that you leaf a changed person. Sometimes for the better, sometimes 
for the worse. This award is for the paper that challenged previously held beliefs, whether 
through arguments within it, understanding extracted from it, or arguments given by participants. 
Regardless of the reason, after reading and interacting with this paper, you find yourself 
different than when you started.

#### The Grizzly

This award is for the paper that is so starkly dedicated to its 
premise that not even a bear could get in its way.

#### The Rorschach
For the paper whose meaning is partly in the eye of the reader: both theoreticians and practitioners walk away convinced it was written for them.
