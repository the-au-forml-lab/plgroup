## Paper Voting

Our tools for paper selection: [plgroup on GitHub](https://github.com/the-au-forml-lab/plgroup).

### Voting Procedure

1. Each week, a pool of **three papers** is selected randomly.
2. Participants select one of those papers by ranked choice vote, and the winning paper is discussed **one week after concluding the vote**.
3. During the voting period, any participant may volunteer to be the **discussion leader**. To do so, they select a paper from the current pool and announce this to the group. In this case, the vote is void and the paper selected by the discussion leader is selected automatically.
4. Once a participant has volunteered to be a discussion leader, they may not do so again until the paper they have selected has been discussed during reading group.
5. At the end of any session where a discussion leader was present, the participants of that session vote on whether the leader succeeded on leading the discussion and clarifying difficult points in the paper for the remaining attendees. If the outcome of the vote is "NO", the discussion leader may not volunteer to lead another discussion until the end of the semester.
6. If multiple participants volunteer to be discussion leaders for papers from the same voting pool:
   - If they all selected different papers, then
     all selected papers are discussed in subsequent sessions of reading group, and no new voting pools are generated for those session. The exact order of the selected papers is left up to the discussion leaders, but they must announce it to the remaining participants in a timely manner.
   - If two or more volunteers selected the same paper, they may either agree to be co-discussion leaders or for some of them to withdraw from being discussion leader.
